## This challenge is basically playing with HTTP Headers to go to the next "level"
so open your burp suite and prepare your repeater for the game ;)

going to the website, we're greeted with a message and a meme

> Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!

we can easily trick it into thinking we're using this "PicoBrowser" by changing the `User-Agent` value which identifies our browser.


>I don't trust users visiting from another site.

adding the `Referer` header, which indicates the URL of the web page that the we were on before accessing the current page..changing the value to the challenge's URL(http://mercury.picoctf.net:36622/ for me)


>Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.

Date header comes to our rescue: `Date: Mon, 05 Jul 2018 10:30:00 GMT`


>I don't trust users who can be tracked.

we need a header that prevents you from getting tracked and with a simple chatgpt question it was revealed as: `DNT: 1` (Do Not Track), assigning its value to 1 as in true.


>This website is only for people from Sweden.

wasn't sure how to bypass it so I tried a couple of things for this one:
`Accept-Language: sv` changing the language to Swedish
`Content-Location: https://example.com/se/index.html` dont ask i knew it won't work but might as well try
til finally I found one that changes your IP, googled swedish ips and put the value with the first one that came up: `X-Forwarded-For: 103.45.246.0`


now sending that request got me the flag but apparently there was a level I missed that said:
>You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?

since I already added the `Accept-Language` I skipped that level and got the flag :D
